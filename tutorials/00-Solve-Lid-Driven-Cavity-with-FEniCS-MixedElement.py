# ## The Navier-stokes equations for incompressible flow

# The steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations can be written as
# 
# \begin{align*} 
#     \left( \mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla \right)\mathbf{u} + \nabla p - 2\mu \nabla \cdot \mathbf{D}(\mathbf{u}) &= 0 \quad \\
#     \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} &= 0 \quad  \\
# \end{align*}
# 
# where  $\mathbf{D}(\mathbf{u}) = \mathrm{sym}(\mathbf{u}) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla \mathbf{u} +  \left( \nabla \mathbf{u} \right)^{\mathrm{T}} \right)$ is the Newtonian fluid's rate of strain tensor. [3]

# We can write the nonlinear system of equations as
# 
# \begin{align*}
# \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{0}
# \end{align*}
# 
# To obtain the finite element weak form, we follow the standard Ritz-Galerkin method extended for mixed finite elements [1]. Therefore, we multiply the system  *from the left* by test functions $\boldsymbol{\psi}$ from the mixed finite element function space $\mathbf{W}$ and integrate over the spatial domain $\Omega$. This gives us the variational problem: Find $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbf{W}$ such that
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     \mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol{\psi};\mathbf{w}) = \int_\Omega 
#     \boldsymbol{\psi}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{w}) 
#     d\mathbf{x} = 0 \quad \forall \boldsymbol{\psi} \in \mathbf{W}
# \end{align*}

# Integrating the weak form by parts yields
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     \mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol{\psi};\mathbf{w}) = (\boldsymbol{\psi}_u, \nabla\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{u}) -(\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{\psi}_u,p) + 2\mu(\mathbf{D}(\boldsymbol{\psi}_u),\mathbf{D}(\mathbf{u})) \\
#     -(\psi_p,\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})
# \end{align*}
# 
# |Note| 
# |----|
# |We denote integrating inner products over the domain as $(v,u) = \int_\Omega v u d \mathbf{x}$ or $(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{u}) = \int_\Omega \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u} d \mathbf{x}$.|
# 
# This is the form that we will implement with FEniCS.

# ## Implementing the variational problem

# We can now implement $\mathcal{F}$ with a few lines of Python code using FEniCS, and run the lid-driven cavity benchmark.

# First, import FEniCS.

# In[1]:


import fenics


# |Note|
# |----|
# | This Jupyter notebook server is using FEniCS 2017.2.0 from ppa:fenics-packages/fenics, installed via `apt` on Ubuntu 16.04.|

# Now, define an initial mesh $\Omega_h \in \Omega$, where the domain $\Omega$ is the unit square.
# 
# |Note|
# |----|
# |Throughout the rest of the implementation, we will omit the ${}_h$ subscript, except when it is explicitly needed to discuss AMR.|

# In[2]:


N = initial_uniform_cell_count = 4

mesh = fenics.UnitSquareMesh(N, N)


# Let's look at the mesh. First we import `matplotlib` and tell this notebook to embed its graphical outputs.

# In[3]:


import matplotlib

get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')


# FEniCS makes it easy to plot the mesh:

# In[4]:


fenics.plot(mesh)

matplotlib.pyplot.title("$\Omega_h$")

matplotlib.pyplot.xlabel("$x$")

matplotlib.pyplot.ylabel("$y$")


# |Note|
# |----|
# |`fenics.plot` does not require us to import `matplotlib`. Rather, we imported this so we could easily annotate the plot.|

# Make the Taylor-Hood (i.e. P2P1) mixed finite element, which has been shown to be stable for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations [3].

# In[5]:


P2 = fenics.VectorElement('P', mesh.ufl_cell(), 2)

P1 = fenics.FiniteElement('P', mesh.ufl_cell(), 1)

P2P1 = fenics.MixedElement([P2, P1])


# |Note|
# |----|
# |`fenics.FiniteElement` requires the `mesh.ufl_cell()` argument to determine some aspects of the domain (e.g. that the spatial domain is two-dimensional).|

# Make the mixed finite element function space $\mathbf{W}$, which enumerates the finite element basis functions on each cell of the mesh.

# In[6]:


W = fenics.FunctionSpace(mesh, P2P1)


# Make the test functions $\boldsymbol{\psi}_u$ and $\psi_p$.

# In[7]:


psi_u, psi_p = fenics.TestFunctions(W)


# Make the system solution function $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbf{W}$ and split it into its components $\mathbf{u}$ and $p$.

# In[8]:


w = fenics.Function(W)

u, p = fenics.split(w)


# Set a constant dynamic viscosity $\mu$. Here we choose $\mu = 0.01$ corresponding to a Reynolds Number of $\mathrm{Re} = 100$. We define a `fenics.Constant` for use in the variational form so that FEniCS can more efficiently compile the finite element code.

# In[9]:


dynamic_viscosity = 0.01

mu = fenics.Constant(dynamic_viscosity)


# Now we have everything we need to define the nonlinear variational form. First let's define aliases for some of the build-in math functions from `fenics` to improve readability. We also define an alias for the integration measure $d\mathbf{x}$.

# In[10]:


inner, dot, grad, div, sym =     fenics.inner, fenics.dot, fenics.grad, fenics.div, fenics.sym
    
dx = fenics.dx


# Define the nonlinear variational form $\mathcal{F}$.

# In[11]:


momentum = dot(psi_u, dot(grad(u), u)) - div(psi_u)*p     + 2.*mu*inner(sym(grad(psi_u)), sym(grad(u)))

mass = -psi_p*div(u)
        
F = (momentum + mass)*dx


# Notice that this is a *nonlinear* variational form. FEniCS will solve the nonlinear problem using Newton's method. This requires computing the Jacobian (formally the GÃ¢teaux derivative) of the nonlinear variational form, yielding a a sequence of linearized problems whose solutions may converge to approximate the nonlinear solution.
# 
# We could manually define the Jacobian; but thankfully FEniCS can do this for us.

# In[12]:


JF = fenics.derivative(F, w, fenics.TrialFunction(W))


# |Note|
# |----|
# |When solving linear variational problems in FEniCS, one defines the linear variational form using `fenics.TrialFunction` instead of `fenics.Function` (while both approaches will need `fenics.TestFunction`). When solving nonlinear variational problems with FEniCS, we only need `fenics.TrialFunction` to define the linearized problem, since it is the linearized problem which will be assembled into a linear system and solved.|

# Now that we have the nonlinear variational *form* $\mathcal{F}$, we are only missing boundary conditions before we can define a nonlinear variational *problem* (i.e. in this case a boundary value problem).
# 
# For the lid-driven cavity, we physically consider *no slip* velocity boundary conditions for all boundaries. These manifest as homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on the fixed walls, but as a non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition on the lid. Because the problem's geometry is simple, we can identify the boundaries with the following piece-wise function.
# 
# \begin{align}
#     \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x}) &= 
#     \begin{cases}
#     \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, && x_1 = 1 \\
#     \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, && x_0 = 0 \hspace{2mm} \mathrm{or} \hspace{2mm} x_0 = 1 \hspace{2mm} \mathrm{or} \hspace{2mm} x_1 = 0
#     \end{cases}
# \end{align}

# In[13]:


lid_velocity = (1., 0.)

lid_location = "near(x[1],  1.)"

fixed_wall_velocity = (0., 0.)

fixed_wall_locations = "near(x[0], 0.) | near(x[0], 1.) | near(x[1], 0.)"


# Define the boundary conditions on the velocity subspace.

# In[14]:


V = W.sub(0)

boundary_conditions = [
    fenics.DirichletBC(V, lid_velocity, lid_location),
    fenics.DirichletBC(V, fixed_wall_velocity, fixed_wall_locations)]


# Now we have everything we need to define the variational problem.

# In[15]:


problem = fenics.NonlinearVariationalProblem(F, w, boundary_conditions, JF)


# ## Goal-oriented adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)

# We wish to solve the problem with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). For this it helps to explain that we have already defined the *discrete* nonlinear variational problem using FEniCS: Find $\mathbf{w}_h \in \mathbf{W}_h \subset \mathbf{W}(\Omega)$ such that
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     \mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol{\psi}_h;\mathbf{w}_h) = 0 \quad \forall \boldsymbol{\psi}_h \in \mathbf{W}_h \subset \mathbf{W}
# \end{align*}

# Given this, goal-oriented AMR poses the problem: Find $\mathbf{W}_h \subset \mathbf{W}(\Omega)$ and $\mathbf{w}_h \in \mathbf{W}_h$ such that
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     \left| M(\mathbf{w}) - M(\mathbf{w}_h) \right| < \epsilon_M
# \end{align*}
# 
# where $M$ is some goal functional of the solution which we integrate over the domain, and where $\epsilon_M$ is a prescribed tolerance. Note that since we do not know the exact solution $\mathbf{w}$, this method requires an error estimator. This is detailed in [2]. For our purposes, we only need to define $M$ and $\epsilon_M$. Let's do this now.
# 
# Published results for the lid-driven cavity often examine the horizontal velocity for verification. Let us make a goal based on this.
# 
# \begin{align}
#     M = \int_\Omega u_0^2 d\mathbf{x}
# \end{align}

# In[16]:


M = u[0]**2*dx


# Let us set the tolerance somewhat arbitrarily. For real problems of scientific or engineering interest, one might have accuracy requirements which could help drive this decision.

# In[17]:


epsilon_M = 1.e-4


# ## The benchmark solution

# Finally we instantiate the adaptive solver with our problem and goal

# In[18]:


solver = fenics.AdaptiveNonlinearVariationalSolver(problem, M)


# and solve the problem to the prescribed tolerance.

# In[19]:


solver.solve(epsilon_M)


# |Note|
# |----|
# |`solver.solve` will modify the solution `w`, which means that `u` and `p` will also be modified.|

# To post-process the solution, we must take an extra step calling `fenics.Function.leaf_node()` to access the solution on the refined mesh.

# In[20]:


u, p = fenics.split(w.leaf_node())


# Now plot the velocity vector field

# In[21]:


fenics.plot(u)

matplotlib.pyplot.title("Velocity vector field")

matplotlib.pyplot.xlabel("$x$")

matplotlib.pyplot.ylabel("$y$")


# and also plot the adapted mesh.

# In[22]:


fenics.plot(mesh.leaf_node())

matplotlib.pyplot.title("Adapted mesh")

matplotlib.pyplot.xlabel("$x$")

matplotlib.pyplot.ylabel("$y$")
